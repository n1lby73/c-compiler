# c-compiler
compile your c and c++ program with a single command


since you're here i assume that you are tired of compiling your codes with up to three lines of command before seeing an error or testing your program

This is a custom script that helps automate that boring process of hitting your keyboard over and over again to do the same task and thus saves time
