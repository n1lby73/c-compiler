# c-compiler

since you're here i assume that you are tired of compiling your codes with up to three lines of command before seeing an error or testing your program

This is a custom script that helps automate that boring process of hitting your keyboard over and over again to do the same task and thus saves time. All with the help of the gcc program that comes pre-installed in all linux distro

And guess what !!!

- you can invoke this script from any directory you're working on
